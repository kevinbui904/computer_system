These are the tests that I, with help from professor Aaron Bauer, has devised
and - for some - implemented to test proxy.c

TEST 1-3 HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN my-driver.sh, simply run the shell script
====================================================================================
1. Test that will check whether proxy will automatically route to tiny port
    even if the port in url is missing (DEFAULT PORT Test)

Implementation detail:
    send a request of the form "http://{domain}/home.html" to proxy
    to pass:
        Proxy need to return home.html 

2. Test that will check whether proxy will return a body in an error 404 
    event 

Implementation detail:
    send a request of the form "http://{domain}:{port}/unknown.html" to proxy 
    to pass:
        Proxy return error.html in its body 

3. Test that will check whether proxy will return a body in a POST 
    request

Implementation detail:
    send a POST request of the form "http://{domain}:{port}/home.html" to proxy
    to pass:
        Proxy will return response.html to signify that it processed the POST 
        request
====================================================================================

4. Test that will check whether proxy will cache files over 32kb in size 

Implementation detail:
    Send a request of the form "http://{domain}:{port}/big.json" to proxy 
    Kill tiny server  
    Send another request of the same form to proxy (e.g. "http://{domain}:{port}/big.json")
    to pass:
        Client SHOULD NOT receive big.json

5. Test that will check whether proxy is storing more than 64kb in its cache 

Implementation detail:
    Send multiple requests of the form "http://{domain}:{port}/{distinct_files}" to proxy 
    Make sure that all the files in cache exceed 64kb 
    Send one more request of the form "http://{domain}:{port}/over.json" to proxy 
    Shut down tiny 
    Request over.json from proxy (e.g. send "http://{domain}:{port}/over.json" to proxy)
    to pass:
        Client SHOULD NOT receive over.json
